                       KnightOS Executable Format (KEXC)

All KnightOS programs meant to be loaded by the kernel must use the KnightOS
Executable Format (KEXC). This format is comparible to the ELF format used on
Linux, in that it contains more than just executable code. It is simpler than
ELF, however, in that it does not contain debugging info and does not require
linking to execute.

Simply put, it takes the following format:

    Address Length  Description

    0x0000  4       The literal ASCII string “KEXC”
    0x0004  - - -   A list of headers
    - - -   1       KEXC_HEADER_END, signals end of list
    - - -   - - -   Additional data to support the headers
    - - -   - - -   Executable code, program data, etc

                                    Headers

The header list is a list of key-value pairs, where each key is 8 bits and each
value is 16 bits. It ends with KEXC_HEADER_END, which does not require a value.
Including a value with KEXC_HEADER_END has no negative side effects.

    Address Length  Description

    0x0000  1       Key
    0x0001  2       Value

When a pointer is used in the value, consider it relative to the start of the
file. If pointing to other header-related structures (for example, KEXC_NAME
points to a string), these structures should reside in the “additional data”
section (as defined above). This is not strictly required, but is a generally
good idea.

The following headers are defined in kernel.inc:

    Name                  Description

    KEXC_HEADER_END       The end of the header list. Value may be omitted.
    KEXC_ENTRY_POINT      Pointer to executable entry point.
    KEXC_STACK_SIZE       Bytes of stack required, divided by two.
    KEXC_KERNEL_VER       Minimum kernel version supported. Major, minor.
    KEXC_THREAD_FLAGS     Thread flags. Only the upper 8 bits are considered.
    KEXC_NAME             Pointer to program name.
    KEXC_DESCRIPTION      Pointer to program description.
    KEXC_RELOCATION_TABLE Pointer to the relocation table.

Header keys are numbered from 0x00-0xFF, inclusive. The 0x00-0x7F range is
reserved for kernel use, and 0x80-0xFF is available for arbitrary use.

                              Executable Programs

When used to describe an executable program, the only required header is
KEXC_ENTRY_POINT (and of course KEXC_HEADER_END).

                               Relocation Table

The relocation table consists of any number of program-relative addresses
terminated by a null word. Those addresses should themselves contain
program-relative pointers to relocate.
