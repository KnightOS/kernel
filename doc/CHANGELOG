                           KnightOS Kernel Changelog

                              === Kernel 0.7.0 ===

Kernel 0.7.0 is largely focused on adding a writable filesystem but also adds a
number of other useful changes. The full changes are:

- Complete driver for KFS 1.0.0
    - Reading from and writing to files is supported
    - Tree manipulation such as deleting files and renaming nodes is supported
    - Symbolic links are supported both by the kernel and by genkfs 1.2.1
- Flash driver improved and supported on all calculators except for the CSE
- Improved random number generation
- Decimal number printing functions added
- More standard string manipulation implemented (strtoi, strstr, etc)
- Better integer math support (faster, more complete)

In addition to changes in the kernel, there have also been improvements in the
rest of the KnightOS world. Interesting ones include:

- Initial release of several tools:
    - The KnightOS SDK, for userspace development: http://www.knightos.org/sdk
    - kpack: A tool for packaging KnightOS software, and manipulating packages
    - packages.knightos.org (KPO) for distributing packages
    - z80e, a portable calculator emulator with a powerful debugger
- Improvements to many tools:
    - genkfs 1.2.1 now supports symlinks, to support new kernel features
    - mktiupgrade with minor bug fixes
- KnightOS userland updates:
    - Now bootstrapped from PKO with all software on seperate release schedules
    - New file management application (fileman)
    - Package management support via the new libkpm
    - Configuration management via the new configlib
    - applib renamed to corelib, with support for new features:
        - corelib(open) supports opening programs and files with their editors
        - Graphical scrollbar support
    - Ported software:
        - Phoenix, the popular game by Patrick Davidson
        - Periodic, originally by Ahmed El-Helw, plus our own improvements
        - Pixel Madness, the demoscene program from Ben Ryves

This kernel is the culmination of effort by an even larger number of people than
before. Thank you to those who helped out with this release:

Looking forward to kernel 0.8.0, we plan to have support for communicating with
PCs both over USB (via MTP) and I/O (via libticables). We also hope to have
support for userspace programs written in C for kernel 0.8.0. If you want to
help out, come get involved at http://www.knightos.org/contribute.

                              === Kernel 0.6.0 ===

Kernel 0.6.0 fleshes out filesystem support, adds partial date/time support, and
adds support for the TI-84+ Color Silver Edition.

Major breaking change: executables now use the new KEXC file format. See
documentation at <http://www.knightos.org/documentation/kexc>.

Detailed changes are:

- New KEXC executable format offers a lot of improvements:
    - Allows users to specify any entry point
    - Allows users to require a minimum kernel version
    - Includes arbitrary user-specified fields
- TI-84+ Color Silver Edition support
    - Includes legacy monochrome LCD emulation
    - Basic graphical functions provided
- Filesystem traversal support via listDirectory
- Adds support for deconstructing timestamps and reading the system clock
- Additional program-level math support (sine, cosine, more operations)
- All registers set to 0 for new threads (except when explicitly changed)

                              === Kernel 0.5.0 ===

This kernel adds support for cryptographic hashing and moves the filesystem
driver to use in-memory stream buffers, as well as adding sorting
implementations and improvement filesystem inspection support.

Major breaking change: the new `pcall` mechanic is used for calling kernel
routines, rather than directly `call`ing them. This allows the kernel to extend
beyond page 0.

- Hashing algorithms supported now include SHA-1 and CRC-16
- Run-length encoding compression/decompression supported
- Filesystem modified to use buffers in RAM during reads
- quicksort and radix sort implemented. The former supports callbacks for
  sorting arbitrary data
- Support for creating and finding directories and ftell
- Add "reassignMemory" function to allow you to assign allocated memory to other
  threads
- Fix kcall to support 0xED-prefixed instructions

Thanks to these great contributors for making it happen:
